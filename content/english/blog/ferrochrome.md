## ABOUT OUR PRODUCT

 Weâ€™ve built broad global suppliers network in Africa, West Asia, Middle East, Austrilia and South America that keeps on providing best-quality Iron Ore, Ferrochrome, Aluminum, Bauxite, Chromium Ore and other resources. A healthy and long-run cooperative relationship creats mutual trust, integrity and added value to all stakeholders.

## What is Ferrochrome



- Ferrochrome is an alloy of iron and chromium, containing between 50% and 70% chromium. The amount of chromium determines the grade of ferrochrome.
The main use of ferrochrome is in the production of stainless steel. It is added to molten steel along with other alloys like nickel to impart corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and strength. The chromium in ferrochrome when added to steel creates a protective layer of chromium oxide on the surface which makes it stain and rust resistant.
- Other uses of ferrochrome include the manufacturing of superalloys, tool steels, wear-resistant parts, and the production of refractory and chemical industry products.
- The largest producers of ferrochrome are South Africa, Kazakhstan, India, and China. South Africa accounts for over half of the global production.
- Ferrochrome is produced by carbothermic reduction of chromium ore (chromite) in electric arc furnaces at high temperatures. The main reactions involve the reduction of chromium oxide to chromium metal by carbon and the formation of iron-chromium carbides.
- The ferrochrome smelting process requires significant amounts of electrical energy. Environmental issues associated with ferrochrome production include dust generation, slag waste, and emissions. Proper environmental controls are required.

So in summary, the main use of ferrochrome is in stainless steel production, owing to its chromium content which imparts corrosion resistance. It also finds other uses in alloy, tool, and refractory manufacturing.

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

##### Code and Syntax Highlighting

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

##### Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>

##### Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty

*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
